Pam can also be found sitting on the couch in the morning complaining about her head. After fully upgrading the Farmhouse and completing the Community Center (or purchasing a JojaMart membership), players are able to purchase a 'Community Upgrade' from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop for 500,000g and 950 Wood. Robin will then build a new house for Pam (and Penny, if the player is not married to Penny). Note that only the host player in a multiplayer game is able to purchase this upgrade. Once the house is built, a cutscene plays during which the player can choose to tell Pam who paid for the home or to remain anonymous. After the house is built, the location on the in-game map changes from 'Trailer' to '2 River Road'.",

The player will receive a letter in the mail on Spring 1 of year 2 saying 'Notice: The price of raw materials at Robin's shop and Clint's shop has increased.' The gold obtained by selling items to Clint (or through the shipping bin) does not increase. Clint can upgrade your tools incrementally. The Pickaxe, Axe, Hoe, and Watering Can can all be upgraded 4 times. It takes 2 days to upgrade a tool. While Clint is upgrading a tool, Blacksmith services are unavailable. The Blacksmith is closed on festival days, except for the Dance of the Moonlight Jellies in the Summer, and the Spirit's Eve festival in the Fall. If you drop a tool off the day before a festival it will be ready the day after the festival. The copper axe allows you to break the large stumps on your farm. It reduces the hits needed to chop down trees. The copper pickaxe allows you to break large rocks in the mine. These give 10 stone. It reduces the hits needed for other rocks. The steel axe allows you to break the logs on your farm. The steel pickaxe allows you to break the large rocks on your farm. The gold pickaxe allows you to break any meteorites that land on your farm. Upgraded versions of the watering can and hoe allow the player to water and till multiple squares of land in a single use.",
