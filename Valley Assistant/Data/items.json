Coal is used in some crafting recipes and is necessary for smelting ore or Quartz in a furnace. A Charcoal Kiln can be used to convert 10 wood into 1 coal. Coal purchased at the Blacksmith costs 150g during year 1, so it is cheaper in year 1 to buy 10 wood for 100g from Robin at the Carpenter's Shop and convert that wood into coal in the Charcoal Kiln. After year 1, wood pricing increases to 50g per piece but coal increases to only 250g, so it is cheaper to purchase coal directly."
